# guitar-chords-web

## TO DOs

- make better readme
- change font sizes on desktop
- change color of contact links
- add contact link to video portfolio, icon could be an empty circle with layouts of what its on the upper side of the current web icon
- add repo to github main page
- design automatic generator of chords, general idea:  
  you pass the position of a finger, and tell it that you want it, for example, major and with three distinctive notes (first, third and fifth), so an alrogithm can be devised to calculate (using intervals) where the other fingers should be, if there is a sufficently comfortable positioning to have them; it would be even cooler if eventually you can drag and drop the finger numbers and see how it smoothly changes the chord shape to where the finger number is dropped
- add more chords, maybe even a backend with the chords
- design some kind of interval visualazer
- design and make a favicon
