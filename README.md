# guitar-chords-web

## TO DOs

- add hosting names in spanish, without dashes too
- keep improving on chords slider
- fix barre tonic color
- add more chords, maybe even a backend with the chords
- make better readme
- add repo to github main page
- design automatic generator of chords, general idea:  
  you pass the position of a finger, and tell it that you want it, for example, major and with three distinctive notes (first, third and fifth), so an alrogithm can be devised to calculate (using intervals) where the other fingers should be, if there is a sufficently comfortable positioning to have them; it would be even cooler if eventually you can drag and drop the finger numbers and see how it smoothly changes the chord shape to where the finger number is dropped
- design some kind of interval visualazer
- design and make a favicon
